              <p>
                Within a few days of enquiring one of our agents will reach out to you. Initially, this will be an informal chat where
                no major decisions will be expected from you. This is simply an opportunity for you and our agent to get to know each
                other and answer any questions you may have about purchasing our land, & The Cayman Islands. This is also an opportunity
                for our agent to find out more about what you are looking for & tailor some of the options and information they send
                over to you.

                You may wish to schedule a number of callbacks & ask a number of questions over email or a messaging service, which our
                agent is more than happy to do. Should you decide to move forward, all you need to do is let our agent know you would
                like to proceed. Once you proceed they will ask you to place a refundable reservation fee which will hold your chosen
                lot of the market for 7 days. This gives you more than enough time to once again go over all the provided information,
                and check over any due diligence documentation with the help of a lawyer. The reservation fee is completely refundable
                should you decide to not go ahead.

                Again, if happy to proceed you will need to provide Oasis Land Development with your ID so we can conduct an AML
                (anti-money laundering check). Oasis Land Development will also issue you with all the draft contracts so they can be
                reviewed by yourself and your legal team.

              <p>
                Once you're happy with everything and have signed the contracts, all that's left to do is pay your agreed deposit. Once
                paid, the agreement will then go to The Cayman Islands for full exchange under Cayman Island law.
